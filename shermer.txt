hello everyone it's time for another episode of the Michael Schumer show I am your host Michael schermer this is a
special episode I don't have a guest today I'm just doing some commentary I'm
going to add probably at least one commentary a week or every two weeks depending on what's going on in society
and what I have to offer to say anything about it uh this one's going to be on
what is a woman anyway I actually wrote one of my skeptic columns on sub stack
almost a year ago on this subject and it's only gotten crazier so before I
dive into that particular column eventually reading it I'm going to add
some commentary at the beginning here when I said things have been getting crazier let me just start off by saying I do
know some trans people um Deidre McCloskey I knew before uh she
transitioned she was Donald mccleskey back in the 90s and uh you know I just
I'm not transpho by I I wish everybody the best that they they can be and find
happiness in any way they can she has struggled Deidra has and has written a memoir about this rejection by her
family and so on it's heartbreaking but that's different from the question of um of Rights and treatment and the
science behind transgenderism which and sexuality or whatever term we want to use let me just
read here from a recent uh tweet that I posted I'll read several tweets here just in the last couple of days really
maybe a week or two here I'm reading from an op-ed that was published in the New York Post and I support the
statement in this country people have a right to express their identity without fear of discrimination or reprisals but
that right does not and should not extend to participation in any activity they wish particularly when that
participation infringes on the rights of an entire class of citizens and threatens to erase more than five
Decades of progress the up editorial writer there is talking about trans men in well trans women male
to female trans entering women's sports uh more to say about that in a moment
um here's some more current events the representative Joe Miller of Ohio
gave a press conference let's see this today is recording this on Friday
April 20th this was on the 14th he held this uh conference in which he said that
um you can actually change biological sex yes he's not talking about gender he gives
his press conferences that uh you can actually change sex and therefore men
who identify as women are biological uh women not men and therefore it's okay
for them to compete in women's sports divisions this is what I wrote about that
astonishing denial of the most basic of biological facts he's not talking about
gender he's claiming that people can change their biological sex by transitioning
wrong a bio male cannot will his body degenerate Fallopian tubes produce eggs
grow a uterus Etc this is utter Madness the madness continues here's the
Governor of Colorado uh who passed a law for Safe Haven trans
tourist Safe Haven in Colorado new laws signed by the states Democrat Governor
Jared Polis mean that teens under the age of 18 from across the United States
can travel to the state and undergo gender reassignment surgery and hormone
replacement therapy without their parents consent or even knowledge
this is celebrated here's what I wrote in my tweet dear
Governor of Colorado again Jared pulse will you explain to minor girls that
after you've cut off their breasts and pump them full of testosterone that the gender reassignment process cannot be
reversed teenagers do not know what they want which is why parental consent for
medical procedures is standard
um right so here's another study I posted this was on parents this is a website parents of rogdkids.com
rodg is the rapid onset gender dysphoria hypothesis here's the quote from this
study the results of the largest survey to date on gender dysphoric adolescence
support Dr Littman's rogd again rapid onset gender uh dysphoria hypothesis
these use most likely are most likely using gender dysphoria to describe
general feelings of dysphoria that they have no other name for and do not understand
transitioning will not help them it can only cause irreversible harm and make things much worse
in other words these are young teenagers going through adolescence and puberty and are confused that's
normal what's not normal is to tell them that there is one cause of their
depression anxiety and general um dysphoria over their body and that is
they're in the wrong body all they have to do is just switch bodies because if you can do that which you can't
but any case that's the theory behind it and it's wrong wrong
here's another woman who's closed her Twitter after she posted this tweet she posted a video
um it's well now she's desisted back to being a boy but anyway here's what I
wrote instead of growing up as a gay boy to become a gay man in a culture now accepting of gays that I'm quoting or
him this is the face and voice of a 30 year old man who looks like a woman and
talks like a woman at age 30 it was pressured to transition to a woman did so secretly without parental
consent and now regrets it there's a lot of these I post them pretty much every couple times a week
here's another tweet from a woman named Hadley Freeman a British author
in this interview with Hadley Freeman she talks about the link between anorexia and people wanting to change
their gender and it's important it is an important component to what we're going through now with the spike in trans ID
particularly girls wanting to be boys edley Freeman talks about this in this
interview as well as in her book in which she talks about getting as she
became an adolescent in her young teens became anorexic her theory of anorexia and I assume this
is probably controversial but this is her theory is that as young girls become women and their
bodies develop with in adolescence they become sexualized by Men by culture Etc
and they're uncomfortable with this they don't know what to make of it and so her Theory again is that
by practicing anorexia they are I guess
converting their bodies back to pre-adolescence and uh and pre-puberty
by just losing so much weight their breasts essentially disappear their hips flatten out or straighten out and so
forth uh she thinks this is an attempt by these young girls to not change
genders or sex but to deal with this confusion of their bodies
uh okay so then there's Riley Gaines I've been following Riley Gaines she is
a world-class NCAA swimmer who competed against Leah Thomas Leah
Thomas is claims to be a woman she at first competed for her first
three years in college as a man and was not even in the top 400 nationally and
transitions in his top of the sport and tied Riley Gaines in a competition
and Riley to her credit is not going to put up with this the NCAA officials at the site of the
competition asked her to let Leah take the Limelight for the tie in this event
and she was none too happy about this and here's what Riley Gaines posted on Twitter
Leah Thomas is not a brave courageous woman who earned a national title she is
an arrogant cheat who stole a national title from a hard-working deserving woman the NCAA is responsible if I was a
woman working at ESPN I would walk out you are spineless ESPN boycott ESPN
and then I posted another um one of her tweets about uh how she
was invited to speak at San Francisco State University and was mobbed as you can imagine cancel
culture in full swing and she was assaulted and had to be locked up in a
another classroom for her protection from the mob and Mr flight home was locked in there
for several hours for her own safety the police campus police did nothing
and then the dean issued a statement apologizing to the Mob for there being
too upset and in their statement they're offering counseling services for our Gator
Community Gators are the San Francisco State University team our gate uh Gator
Community including faculty staff members coaches and mentors and the peaceful protesters so that they may
recover uh from assaulting Riley Gaines this is what I wrote this is a Bizarro world
and here's what Riley posted on her Twitter I'm sorry did this just say peaceful
I was assaulted I was extorted and held for ransom the protesters demanded that
I pay them if I wanted to make it home safely I missed my flight home because I was barricaded in a classroom
we must have different definitions of peaceful okay this is insane here's another case
posted yesterday on April 19th uh from the week before
there's a photograph Windsor Police are searching for a sexual assault suspect wanted in
connection to a sexual assault reported on April 4th 2023. the suspect has been
identified as 32 year old Desiree Anderson who may also be known as Cody and Tremont
so there's a picture of him I'll just say it long hair he may identify whatever he wants but he's got a nice
thick five o'clock shadow and long hair it looks like a guy it is a guy and he assaulted a woman
a female victim contacted police on April 4 to report that she had been sexually assaulted while staying at the
Windsor women's shelter are you following This Thread this guy checked himself into a women's shelter
and then sexually assaulted the women there a woman there the suspect has reported to have been staying at the shelter at
the same time and allegedly climbed into the victim's bed and sexually assaulted her
police say that the suspect is known to frequent the downtown area has been identified as 32 year old Desiree
Anderson also known as Cody and Tremont okay
that this just goes on and on it's it's constant here's another one uh no that was it that's that's enough
for now okay what is all this confusion about what is a woman anyway
let me Now read from my skeptic column um in which I addressed this question
it's not a hard question but people are just hopelessly confused about this
in his 1953 book philosophical investigations the philosopher Ludwig
Wittgenstein introduced the concept of language games in which he argued that Concepts do not need perfect clarity for
meaning to be found in them with games as his type specimen we speak of board
games card games dice games arcade games athletic games War Games betting games
drinking games and even multiplayer online battle arena games but just try to find the common
denominator of the conceptual category of games that runs through all of them
many games involve physical activity such as tennis and bowling but most board card and dice games do not besides
moving the pieces flipping the cards or rolling the dice games are usually something one does for
fun but as often as not people play them with an intensity reserved for the most serious of life's challenges
games often involve competition against others but not so for contests against the clock or against your previous best
performance or even solitaire many games involve winning and losing but party games are designed to
encourage social interaction not zero-sum Victory and defeat games sometimes involves skill but many
board games depend on the randomness of a die roll or a spinner and so forth
wickenstein's broader point is that rules of language are analogous to rules of games
in which meaning depends on common agreement among players of games or users of words
for example the concept of game cannot be reduced to a necessary and sufficient set of features that cover all specific
examples but we know when when we see one how
family resemblance or a loose Confederation of characteristics that applies to most
examples most of the time such meanings are not demarcated by
sharp and well-defined borders but instead blend into one another across blurred boundaries
call them fuzzy sets arguably the most famous example comes from the United States Supreme Court Justice Potter
Stewart in his 1964 case decision Jacob Ellis versus Ohio over what exactly
constitutes pornography quote from Justice Stewart I shall not
today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that short description
hardcore pornography and perhaps I could never succeed and intelligibly doing so
but I know it when I see it and the motion picture involved in this case this is Louis mulls the lovers is not
that in his 2021 book rationality psychologist and linguist Stephen Pinker
invokes The Offspring of Robert Kardashian and Kristen Jenner as literal
examples of family resemblance because even though not every Scion has the
pouty Kardashian lips or the Raven Kardashian hair or the caramel Kardashian skin or the ample Kardashian
derriere most of the sisters have some of them so we can recognize our Kardashian when we see one
even if there is no true proposition if someone has features X and Y and Z that
person is a Kardashian most Concepts have exceptions yet we can
agree on a flexible set of characteristics that roughly represents the category
chairs or seats with legs and backs allowing for exceptions like bar stools with a seat and legs but no back
exceptions don't refute the rule they help demarcate the thickness of the fuzzy boundaries
this is a quote from Carol Tavern some apples are not red some dogs do not bark some birds do not fly but all the
instances of a concept do share a family resemblance when we need to decide whether something
belongs to a concept we are likely to compare it to a prototype a representative instance of the concept
which dog is dogier a golden retriever or a Chihuahua I'd say golden retriever
but anyway which fruit is more fruit like an apple or a pineapple Apple which activity is more
representative Sports football or weightlifting most people within a culture can easily tell you which instances of a concept
are most representative or prototypical so it's quote from Carol tavers
family resemblance concepts by themselves are not enough tavernous ads noting that we must also represent their
relationships to one another in the form of propositions or units of meaning that
are made up of Concepts and that Express a unitary idea these in turn are linked together in
complicated networks of knowledge associations beliefs and expectations that psychologists call cognitive
schemas that serve as mental Frameworks for describing and thinking about various
aspects of the world gender schemas for instance represent a person's beliefs and expectations about
what it means to be male or female a mother is a woman who gives birth to a
child but what about adoptive mothers surrogate mothers and egg donor mothers
and pink and Pinker cautions from his uh book rationality you can get into a lot
of trouble these days if you try to lay out the necessary and sufficient conditions for woman
indeed just ask Matt Welsh the daily wire conservative host and writer whose
new documentary film asks what is a woman in a borat-like series of conservation
conversations and encounters Walsh can't seem to get a straight answer from anyone including the University of
Tennessee chair of the interdisciplinary program in women gender and sexuality
Patrick rozonka who answered the titular question thusly
well when someone tells you who they are you should believe them if a person tells you they are a woman or a man
they're telling you what their gender is let's quote unsatisfied with this answer Walsh presses his subject what is a
woman this exchange is emblematic of post-modernism's turn to obsurantism
rizanka why do you ask that question Walsh because I'd really like to know
what do you think the answer is I'm asking you a college professor that studies this subject
what other answers have you gotten clearly frustrated Walsh explains that
others he's queried are equally obfuscating grizanka the simple answer is a person
who identifies as a woman what do they identifying as a woman but
what is that as a woman do you know what a circular definition is
of course grazonka perfectly well knows the answer to that question so he pivots
you're seeking what we call in my profession an essentialist definition of gender
that's right because essentialist definitions are examples of family resemblances or fuzzy sets that must
contain some agreed upon characteristics or else the words are meaningless
but krzonka's Dodge is not uncommon in Academia today and in exasperation with
Walsh's persistent questioning in search of the truth grizanka announces on camera getting to the truth is deeply
transphobic unbelievable that is just unbelievable
statement the truth doesn't matter it's transphobic no this is wrong wrong
let me just I know you know when somebody says men can get pregnant men can menstruate
well yes if by man you mean woman okay you see what I'm saying what do
these words mean this is why I wrote this essay in recent years the Calamity against
objective truth has grown like Kudzu over the ivory walls and into nearly all
aspects of society as evidenced in the many other confused subjects in Walsh's film
there's gender affirmation therapist Gert comfrey who explains that people
are assigned a gender at Birth based on genitalia this is a girl or this is a boy we now know that sex and gender are
far more than just this binary some women have penises and some men have vaginas
close quote if so then what do those words mean what is a woman she is at
great question replies the female looking comfrey but then she continues I'm not a woman so I
can't really answer that okay
a group of New York City women do no better sputtering out through nervous laughter Oh that's a tough one an
unnamed woman offers someone who thinks of themselves as delicate and pretty
nice an unnamed cross-dressing man suggests a woman is someone who identifies as a
woman and Walsh's rejoinder but what is that is met with
I honestly don't know Marcy Bowers tagged as the world's
preeminent gender reassignment surgeon and Who self-identifies as a woman with
a trans history in other words male to female MTF trans
a woman as a combination of your physical attributes and what you're
showing to the world and the gender clues that you give and hopefully those match your gender identity
hopefully presumably that's what genital surgery aims to do
for example vaginoplasty in which a portion of a biological male's body is sculpted to
look and function like female anatomy but as Helen Joyce points out in her
book trans when ideology meets reality and in our conversation on my podcast
these vaginas do not work like those of a biological female though such surgeries produce what is in
essence a fleshy tube for people who identify as male to penetrate with a
penis a very male-centric view of vaginas that objectifies women as essentially
bodies for men to use for feminists like Joyce this is a stark reversal of a century of women
struggling to be perceived as more than their body parts Walsh next turns to Michelle forcier a
consultant pediatrician at Hasbro Children's Hospital Rhode Island who asserts that gender affirmation means
listening to children's stories about who they think they are because telling parents that a newborn is 100 a certain
gender based on genitalia is not correct a woman Dr forsier explains is someone
who claims that as her identity it could be many things to many people
do gametes make someone a male or female Walsh queries no she retorts sperm does
not make you a male because some women have penises and some men have vaginas
right if so then why does a person assigned at Birth as a male but who identifies as a
female need to remove the penis why does a person assigned at Birth as a
female but who identifies as a male need to add a penis if a woman or a man is whatever anyone
claims is their identity based on internal beliefs and feelings instead of external equipment as one online
influencer told Walsh some people are boys some people are girls some are both
some are neither gender is all about how you feel on the inside and how you express yourself
then why would anyone put themselves through the ordeal of transitioning
consider what's at stake in these medical procedures after undergoing seven surgeries to
transition from a female to a male fdm Scott Nugent offered this forensic
archaeological account if someone dug up my body a century from now they'd say yep that's a woman
in fact forensic archaeologists also employ family resemblances and fuzzy sets when identifying skeletons
now an educator and activist against radical trans activism Nugent lists his
personal reasons for caution one pulmonary embolism one helicopter ride
to the ER 17 rounds of antibiotics tear on the inside of his urethra that took
17 months to eliminate and infections every three to four months no one would help me including the
doctor who did this to me because I lost my insurance Nugent recounted adding I'm
probably not going to live very long what about those who transition without
such complications and regrets consider the account of Gabrielle Mack
the author of the widely read cover story of the December 2021 issue of New
York Magazine Mac is a female to male trans who describes himself as an
asexual gay man with a penis and a vagina after a double mastectomy and a
phalloplasty surgery creating a penis out of a chunk of skin carved out of his thigh Mac explains what all is involved
in the process if you just Google his name you'll see the cover of New York
Magazine with his picture there showing this gruesome huge chunk of skin missing
from his leg that he had made into a penis here he is while I'd been sleeping two micro
surgeons a reconstructive urologist a surgical fellow and a surgical resident
had among other things cut a seven by six inch rectangle out of my right anterior lateral thigh
they'd taken all of the skin and fat plus one big nerve and some veins attached to the muscle
and connected the skin to itself in the shape of a phallus then they slipped the whole thing under
two of my thigh muscles pulled it out of the way with a steel retractor dragged the phallus across my groin Under the
Skin and pulled it back out into the world through a hole cut in the skin over my pubic bone they connected the
new penis's nerve to one of the nerve bundles in my native penis which some people call it clitoris embryologically
the cells are the same which they cut free of its ligaments then skinned then
tunneled up under the skin and out to The Landing site of the new penis the base of which they joined at the base of
my pelvis putting me all together with sutures some finer than a human hair
one of the film's counter voices is the psychiatrist Dr Miriam Grossman
author of you're teaching my child what who articulates the importance of
distinguishing between people who genuinely have gender dysphoria her estimated rate is between one and
thirty thousand and one in one hundred and ten thousand and what is happening today where kids with no history of
discomfort with their biological sex seem to be getting swept up in a social contagion in which transgender people
are not merely accepted but lionized in this account I link in the substack
column one of many such stories recounted by shocked parents a quarter seven out of 28 of her daughter's class
claims to be trans sex Grossman explains is biology sex is
unchanging 99.999 of the cells in the body are marked either male or female
by contrast gender is a perception a feeling a way of identifying it's an experience that's subjective
this graph which I feature in the skeptic column you can check it michaelschermer.substack.com and then
look under what is a woman anyway from Gallup polling data captures what happens when that subjective experience
is shaped by social influences in this case resulting in a hundred percent increase in LGBT identification in
Generation Z compared to Prior Generations in a Pew survey a Pew survey
corroborates the finding quote the share of U.S adults who are transgender is
particularly High among adults younger than 25. in this age group 3.1 percent
are a trans man or a trans woman compared with just point 0.5 percent of
those age 25 to 29. that's a six-fold difference I have a graph showing that
this data gain says the hypothesis that a more tolerant Society has allowed more people to come out because if so we
should see increases in all age cohorts but we don't it's possible older cohorts will come
out later as Society grows more tolerant but at the moment it appears something began to change in 2017 and that's
something could be a social contagion among youth to identify as something other than cisgender straight
Carl Truman a theologian at Grove City College and author of The Rise and
Triumph of the modern self explains to Walsh the psychology behind the Contagion
trans is cool trans is a way of giving yourself value all of the things that
used to give us anchors of identity have become very fluid so new identities start to fill the void of the vacuum
whereas in the past I might have gotten my self-worth from being part of a village where I grew up
now I might get my self-worth from being part of an online community or the sexual identity community
I had a trans student at Chapman University she's 18 and decided she wanted to be a boy
in the middle of classes seminar so we all talk a lot about different things and I asked them about their opinions on
a great many subjects like these and she announced that she wanted to change her name she started dressing like a boy cut
her hair and so on and then revealed that in fact she was also on the spectrum of autism had some OCD was
depressed was being treated for anxiety depression suicidal ideation and so on for years
and in fact as the semester went on it became clear to me she didn't really want to be a boy or a man she wanted to
be trans and she just got a ton of love and attention from this and anyway she ended up dropping out I just
could not concentrate on her studies this is unfortunate
with selfhood itself at stake it's no wonder otherwise rational and tolerant
people tiptoe around the topic as evidenced in the Congressional hearings over Supreme Court nominee katani Brown
Jackson who when asked by Republican senator Marsha Blackburn can you provide
a definition of the word woman understood the loaded question for what it was and politely declined to answer
dissembling I'm not a biologist that katani brown Jackson along with you
and me and nearly everyone else on the planet knows perfectly well what a woman and a man is tells us that something
else is going on here a semantic shift a conceptual contrivance to shake us out of our Enlightenment liberal commitment
to Universal realism and the search for objective truth just as Force equals mass times
acceleration f equals ma planets travel in elliptical orbits and sweep out equal
areas in equal times entropy increases in a closed system mass is conserved in
a chemical reaction DNA is a molecular double helical structure and all living
organisms are descended from common ancestors in a sexually reproducing mammalian species like ours females and
males are distinctly different and should be able to be defined as such
here is where the trouble begins and why we need fuzzy sets and family resemblances to properly capture the
conceptual truth about women and men most people that think that sex is defined by xx and XY chromosomes but as
the Harvard evolutionary biologist Carol hooven notes in her 2020 book T the story of testosterone the hormone that
dominates and divides us sex chromosomes aren't always xx and XY
and birds for example males have a pair of identical sex chromosomes ZZ and
females have two different ones z w what's more many species don't even rely
on chromosomes to make males and females and turtles and crocodiles it's the temperature of the eggs that determines
the sex of the hatchlings and animals don't always stay one sex or the other even coral reef dwelling clownfish is
born male and some time later switched to female what criteria should be used to
distinguish males from females the relative size of the sex cells are gametes who even explains echoing the
definition of green on by the vast majority of biologists males produce small mobile gametes sperm
and females produce larger immobile gametes eggs although even here hooven cautions
readers not to take this definition too strictly in as much as my son doesn't yet make sperm but he's still male and
although my ovaries are no longer regularly producing eggs I'm no less female than when they were cranking them out on a monthly schedule
rather it's the design plan for the gametes that counts
that design plan for producing two different types of gametes is what you would expect in a sexually reproducing
species like ours so that seems as foundational a conceptual category as we're going to get in defining females
and males while still allowing for the rare outliers as such and by this definition females
can't produce and ejaculate sperm and males can't produce eggs and get pregnant
as these words are understood today we can say with confidence that women do not have penises and men do not have
vaginas biological females can undergo a double mastectomy and get his penis carved out
of a skin fold and other body parts and biological males can get silicon breast implants and a faux vagina but they
don't work like the organs of their biological holotypes the reason is that
the family resemblance fuzzy set representing female or woman contains far more than breasts than a vagina
look under the hood and you'll find hundreds if not thousands of differences with men from anatomical and
physiological decognitive and emotional then I post a link to the issue of
skeptic we devoted to trans matters however the language games play out with
this issue in the coming years and whatever the science provisionally concludes about the actual rate of trans
Sans bonds the social contagion element it's good to remember that trans rights
are human rights and that discrimination based on sexual or gender identity along with sexual orientation and other
protecting classes is both illegal and immoral no one should be fired for being trans much less treated as less than
human the fuzzy set of homo sapiens includes all of us regardless of how we subdivide
the species and a cheeky ending to his film Matt Walsh returns home from his gender
bending journey to ask the one person he is certain knows the answer to his question his wife Penelope
what is a woman an adult human female who needs help opening this she replies ending them a
stubborn pickle jar several female reviewers who were otherwise cautiously positive about the
film took mild offense at this nod to the 1950s but I saw it as contrived
humor to relieve and otherwise deadly serious subject being driven by contemporary politics ideological
extremes and conceptual confusions what would wittenstein say
